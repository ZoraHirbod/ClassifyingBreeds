# ClassifyingBreeds
Here, the Oxford-IIIT pet dataset is used to classify breeds. It has 37 different breeds types of cats and dogs images. There are about 200 images in each of the 37 categories within this dataset. Fastai library (convolutional neural network (CNN)) is used to model this classification problem. General steps were taken to do the modelling:
1- Load the necessary libraries & the dataset
2- Labelling the dataset and training the model
3- Applying convolutional neural network (CNN)
4- Prediction
5- Model performance
